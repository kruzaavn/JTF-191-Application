        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>We would like to welcome you To Joint Task Force 70. We are a group of like minded flight sim enthusiasts who formed this group about 4 years ago. We wanted to develop a simulation group that tries its best to capture the depth of military operations but also has fun in the process. We have 7 active fighter and attack squadrons flying the F/A-18 Hornet, F-16 Falcon, F-14 Tomcat and AV-8B Harrier and are always looking to add more aircraft to have a truly joint expereince.</p>
        <p>We will help guide and train you to become the best aviator we can. We currently have active and retired military personal within our ranks, that help guide most realistic training possible. We have a rank system just like many groups out there, but that's to make sure all members get the most they can out of the group. All pilots start off in our training squadrons, learning all the controls, functions and maneuvers. For a list of everything you will be learning click on our training pipeline Page.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for an all around good group of people, fill out an application we will review it and contact you. Thank you for your interest and have a great day.</p>
        <h1>***REMINDER***</h1><p>This is a United States based Joint Task Force. All events will be coordinated off of US times.</p>
